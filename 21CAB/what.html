	I'm sure you've seen what this webzine is about before. It's this thing!
	</p>
	<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/kidzbop1.png"/></div>
	<p>
	It's the thing where a company pretends to be a Kid in order to attract Kids to its Cool Hip Product. Typically you laugh at it, which is good, because it's usually pretty funny. This has probably happened for decades, at least since brands went from brands to Brands, but now, as our web humor gets weirder, the advertising is getting weirder too.

	It's very easy to dismiss this as out-of-touch old people, but there is also a far more insidious genre of this type of thing that is actually very funny, intentionally. Currently, <a href="http://dennys.tumblr.com">Denny's Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dennys">Denny's Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog's Twitter</a> are all good examples. These often, rather than trying to directly borrow from youth culture, use the aesthetics in creative ways of their own.

	(The text accompanying that on the Denny's tumblr is “Denny’s is the closest thing to a fantasy hospital where you could come in, hook yourself up to a chicken drip, relax, and nurture yourself. If only we had reclining beds in addition to booths…”)
