	It's no secret that our society is collapsing a little bit. All you have to do is type in <a href="nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a> into your browser, for example, and you can see that there are a lot of bad things happening. But it's more than that - the things that are happening make no sense. Most recently, we have elected somebody who dispenses with all the conventions of American politics, such as generally trying to tell the truth, appear leaderly, or claiming to believe in science, but this has been going on for several years. The media has been engaged in explaining why the youth generation is lazy and entitled while study after study shows that <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/09/504989751/u-s-kids-far-less-likely-to-out-earn-their-parents-as-inequality-grows">they are going to be the first generation in history to be worse off than their parents</a>. Tech has created a new boom for the American economy, but these immensely successful companies only employ on the order of thousands of workers to create what was previously deemed impossible.

	In the midst of this environment of unprecedently democratic creation tools and optimism, those who the society is in the process of leaving behind (and their buddies who happen to be studying computer science) have begun to create underground popular entertainment that calls to mind the historic movement of art that makes no sense - Dada. (<a href="http://mizuki-takashima.tumblr.com/post/138072197441/stormingtheivory-leftclausewitz">These people</a> have a much better summary than I could ever give on a website that is primarily a social network for weird high school kids)

	Since many companies target the youth with their products, they have begun to try to coopt this vernacular. Unfortunately, as the source of much of the subject of this critique, they typically do not succeed. This usually comes across as pretty funny, and therefore becomes incorporated into the source material of the remix culture from which it is attempting to draw. When they do succeed, it is a notable event, but in its blindness or wilful opposition to the politics of this accidental art movement, can serve to hide ills such as abuse of workers.
